Sequels are rarely better than the originals, 
but Johnny Depp will have definitely enjoyed this second installment.

Wednesday's verdict is a huge change of fortune for him. 
Two years ago, he was soundly defeated on similar libel claims in a UK court.

Back then, Depp sued The Sun newspaper over an article that called him a "wife beater" 
and alleged he had assaulted his ex-wife Amber Heard.

Depp denies ever assaulting Heard, but the British tabloid maintained its article was accurate.

With Heard testifying on its behalf, the tabloid was able to prove in that case 
that the details in its story were "substantially true".

In this follow-up trial across the Atlantic, Depp arguably faced even lower odds of success.

In England, the burden of proof for defamation rests with the 
alleged slanderer, who must show what they said is true.

But in the US, a defamed person must prove what was said about them isn't true. 
Depp also had to prove Heard had written the article with "actual malice".
