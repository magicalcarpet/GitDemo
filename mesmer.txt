Life must have its mysteries
Three rings for the elven kings under the sky
Seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of stone
Nine for mortal men doomed to die
One for the dark lord in the land of Mordor where the shadows lie

One ring to rule them all
One ring to find them
One ring to bind them in the land of Mordor where the shadows lie
