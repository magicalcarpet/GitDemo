If you are able to look at things objectively, you can see just how sick and twisted they really are.

They treat reality based on how they believe it to be. Full of jealousy, shame, and hatred they do nothing other than project it outward in their actions. It's rather disturbing when you witness it first hand.

Jealousy- They are jealous of most people due to their severe insecurities. They create situations whenever possible to try to envoke jealousy in others. It's not even about you being jealous of them as they just want you jealous. Makes you weak to them. They need to feel superior, always.

Shame- These people are literally engulfed in shame. That's why they are the way they are. They can be such shitty human beings, seeing they have to expend their dignity all day to quench their insatiable thirst for attention and validation. While at the same time manipulating everyone around them to feel inferior somehow, as an outlet for that very shame.

Hatred- These people hate themselves, therefore they hate everyone. They feel nothing. Either you are superior to them in which they work to micro abuse you with all sorts of manipulation to feel they are winning. You are too dumb and praise them, which they then hate you for being weak. Or you challenge them which they then get excited and it becomes a hunt for them. That is until you beat them so badly and send them into a shame spiral. Which is easy to do. Document then expose to the right people.

This is 2019 and it's worse than ever. Narcissists are social media experts with all sorts of means of spreading fake news. You have to be able to look at what the message is really saying and listen to your gut. Your gut knows when it's bad juju. Easy to prove, too.

Shame is the biggest indicator. Good people shield others from shame while covert narcs puke it outward all day long. Good people don't play with your emotional well being with silent treatment or making you feel angst. Covert narcissists do. They want you to love them and admire them. They are perfect in every way. You should be lucky they even acknowledged you. (their mindset) They just want control.

They are easy to spot once you understand their mindset. Being an empath they flock to me. I find them fascinating and don't blame them for what their parents did to them. I'd like to believe I'm impervious to anyone's projections but I'm just human and they will get to me sometimes. That's OK. Feelings are temporary and they are my own. I just learned to spot them quickly and run like hell in the opposite direction. I'm not in a position to be patient with them so I either avoid them or expose them to protect myself if need be.





The 5 Fears

Abandonment
Loss Of Control
Exposure Of What They Really Are
Loss Of Resources (Money, Social Status, Material Goods)
Appearing Inferior, Inadequate

Defences are: Lying, Commiting Crimes, Defaming, Calling In Law Enforcement, Cageyness, Abuse and Smear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Exposure is their biggest fear in life. Concealment their motivation behind everything they do.

They are empty, hollow beings on the inside. Nothing but swirling clouds of jealousy, envy, greed, lust, etc. There is nothing of substinence to them. No love, no personality, nothing unique. We tell story after story, experience after experience that tells the same thing in different settings, different parts of the world, the same people with different faces. You ever wonder how my ex husband sounds just like, say, your mom for example? Your mom sounds like the next person's brother. Their brother sounds just like his ex wife. Names, ages, locations, genders, circumstance all very different. But yet….we describe the same person?

No other group of people will this happen. Sure we all have similar traits as survivors because I have a face and so do you. But we are real. Made out of something. We have talents and gifts. Personalities. Emotions. Flaws of our own. But at least we are our own.

Control is their hobby. A favorite pass time. All of them Olympic gold medalist in manipulation. All of it is to keep us from noticing they are nothing. Everything has to be so chaotic and confusing and made to be our fault because if it wasn't we might look to them for human interaction. They can't give what they do not have. Their existence is based on their convincing us that abuse and love are the same thing.

We are not here for their entertainment or for their supply. We are mere camouflage to them. They have to have spouses, kids, families to hide in. If it was acceptable in society for them to spin their heads around 360 degrees and lick their own eyeballs maybe they wouldn't need us. But we need them regardless. To teach us what we are supposed to learn about ourselves. They are here for us, not the other way around. To polish us into what we're becoming. I've been looking at this all wrong. We are not meant to supply. They have been supplying us all along with the things we need to grow into ourselves.

We can not appreciate the peace without the chaos. We can't appreciate the love without the heart break. We can't be strong without resistance. They are our resistance on our road to be coming warriors.

Narcissists always show their true colors, as long as you’re not color blind and know what to look for.

Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by traits such as

An exaggerated sense of entitlement
A lack of empathy/concern for others
Being manipulative and self deceived
Feeling superior to others
Arrogance


Narcissists are always like this, regardless of whether they are viewing the other person in an idealized way, and “love bombing” them, or viewing them in a devalued way, and being cruel, often by means of shaming/blaming/criticizing and sarcasm.

Whether they’re being Dr. Jeckyl (nice) or Mr. Hyde (cruel), the underlying motivation of selfishly manipulating others to do their bidding with no respect to their well being of the remains unchanged. If you know what to look for, the narcissistic “color” can be recognized immediately.

What are things to look for?

Being self absorbed (e.g. hijacking conversations, fishing for compliments in the idealization phase, or blowing off your concerns in the devaluation phase)
Being manipulative (by being either sweet or nasty, narcissists are always angling to get you to do their bidding)
Being unable to accept responsibility for any wrongdoing or even wrong thinking
Having a vapor trail of failed relationships, which are always the fault of the other person
Being cluelessly selfish with utter disregard to how their selfishness impacts others
Because narcissists can be very pleasant to be around (e.g. when they’re “love bombing”), it may appear that they are not manifesting their true colors, but they are. All the aspects pointed out above will be easily visible, as long as you’re not distracted by their flattery, syrupy sweetness, and so forth, if in the idealization phase.

To summarize, the thing to be aware of is that the true colors of the narcissist are not manifest by whether or not they’re being sweet or nasty, but by the underlying features of being self absorbed, manipulative, deceived, entitled, arrogant and so forth. For example, they can be arrogant, self absorbed, manipulative and kind, or arrogant, self absorbed, manipulative and mean, but their always going to be arrogant, self absorbed, and manipulative, which is their true colors.

What will a narcissist protect at all costs?

Themselves. Their image of superiority, their truth even when blatantly lying, their power & control over you & others, their entitlement to have what they want from you exactly when they want it, their image of greatness, their demands that must be met at all cost. The list is endless, but at the end of it a they protect THEMSELVES, THEIR NEEDS & WANTS.

============================================================================

I’ve made a list for myself. I am going to read it over and over until these are ingrained in my memory for when I need to use one. I recommend anyone dealing with a Narcissist write some of these down and customize them for your personal experiences with a Narcissist. The Narcissist in my life is very intellectual and is very good at making his point sound like it is the truth and is the only correct answer. So for me I think that these statements will help in diffusing the argument from turning into me trying to defend myself against something that I wont win. I also added several questions to ask the Narcissist. They will most likely not answer them, but Narcissists are smart and will think about what you said later. Because they remember everything you say. So instead of saying things that they can laugh about later, give them something to actually reflect on. Also remember that the only thing you should EVER apologize for is to apologize that they feel a certain way. Have you ever heard a Narcissist say sorry? Me either.

Let me know what you think about these. Here we go:

·

___ has really upset you.

·

Why do you think you react in such an emotional way when ___? Does ___ trigger a memory from your past?

·

I am simply asking you a regular question.

·

Why are you getting defensive?

·

Why are you getting so emotional?

·

Majority of people would not react in such a way to ___.

·

I see that you are (insert emotion).

·

Getting angry is not going to solve your issue. (remember that whatever they are mad about is their issue not yours)

·

I am not the one with the issue right now.

·

I do not agree, but you have a right to feel however you want to feel, just like I do. (Validate that he has the right to feel how he is feeling, and remind him that you too have this right.)

·

Your approach is not working.

·

Okay. (best response if it is a situation that is not even worth engaging in. This should be the “Go-To Line”.)

·

I do not understand why you think that.

·

You may not believe it to be true, but it is. I am not going to try and convince you of the truth. (especially when he is wrong about something. I find that even if I go through the trouble to pull up DEFINITE EVIDENCE, he will refuse to believe me. This has happened over the most simplest of things. For example, we love music and were talking in depth about how some artists charge money for their mixtapes, which are normally free. When I was in college, Drake released a mixtape called “If You’re Reading This, It’s Too Late”. This is a mixtape but since Drake has a deal with Apple, Apple was charging via iTunes a fee for their customers to purchase the mixtape. I brought this up during our conversation, which was going very well. But he said “No, that is not a mixtape it is an album.” and after he stated that, I tried to convince him of why it was actually a fact. He is very big on “facts” and he feels like everything he says is a fact. I actually googled the mixtape and pulled up the credentials showing that it was indeed a mixtape. He refused to look. It turned into an argument and ended in him saying that I ruin our conversations and that I do too much talking and need to just listen more. Please remember that they do not deserve anything to be explained to them. Think of it as this - If I had the above conversation with a normal person, they would have said something like “Oh wow! I didn’t know that. Cool.” A narcissist cannot be proven wrong, so why are you going to bother? If they disagree with you over something so minimal, do not even bother explaining it. You have to be very humble and willing to let proving yourself go. UNLESS it is something on a more serious level.)

·

If that is what you want to believe/think, then I am not going to try and convince you otherwise.

·

What did you say? (Make them repeat themselves. This one is petty… They may even walk away from what they started in the first place simply because they hate to repeat themselves.)

·

I hear you. (Acknowledge what they said but do not defend or argue otherwise you are just ignigting the gasoline that they poured all over you.)

·

I don’t understand you.

·

I don’t believe you.

·

Yes, you did. (They love love LOVE to deny something they did when they know it is wrong. Especially in trying to make you think your memory is wrong. “I never said that” “You’re crazy. Where did you come up with that?” “You’re so delusional!” is something I hear a lot. Sadly I actually do have a lot of trouble recalling memories, but I am not stupid and I have fallen for this so many times. Questioning myself. From now on, do not question yourself. If you remember him doing something, especially knowing he is a narc, then STICK BY IT. Do not let him sway your memory. Simply tell him that you know he did do it. And he will retort with a question he knows you can’t answer, “When did I do that? When did I say that? Where is the evidence that I did/said that?” They will act like they need you to give an exact time and day of when they did it and if you cannot give them an answer, to them that means you are wrong. In REAL REALITY, an average human is not going to be able to recall such details, especially during an argument filled with tense emotions. It is SO illogical of them to expect this. So I find that I like to explain, “You cannot expect someone to give such ridiculous proof, I know what is true, and so do you. I am not going to waste my time trying to explain what is already known to be true.” And anything they have to say after that should be responded with a simple “Okay.” because at that point you have already said what you need to say and you have no need to make any more points.

·

You are acting like a child.

·

You are wrong.

·

Okay.

·

I’m not afraid of you.

·

Your perspective is interesting.

·

I don’t expect anything more from you.

·

You are reacting how I expect you to react.

·

I’m sorry that you think that.

·

I’m sorry that you feel like that.

·

Your anger is not logical.

·

I have no right to control how you choose to see things.

·

You perception of me is faulty, but I cannot change how you think.

·

Your anger is not my responsibility.

·

That does not deserve a response.

·

That is your reality, not mine.

·

Let’s talk about this when you have calmed down.

·

Your expectations are not reasonable. You expect too much.

·

Do you believe that it is okay to constantly demand me to change myself? Why?

·

Why do you expect so much from me, but I cannot expect anything of you?

·

I am very loved, just like you. (he has told me no one loves me and that no one would ever want to be with me. And that I have no friends.)

·

I don’t have to explain myself. Just like you don’t. Remember? (Any time I ask him a question that he does not like, he refuses to give direct answers or to explain himself. If he feels like he can do that to me, then explain to him that he should expect the same from you. Remind him that you are equals.)

·

Your question is only meant to prolong the argument. I am not participating.

·

Why would you say something so devaluing to someone? That’s not a good trait to have.

·

Okay. If that is how you feel.

·

I would like to talk to you more when you are not being hateful.

·

How you are reacting is not normal.

·

How you are behaving is not attractive.

·

Would you talk like this to your friends?

·

Your excuses does not validate treating me this way.

·

Why do you choose to hurt the person that loves you the most?

·

You take my unconditional love for you for granted. One day you might realize this.

·

I deserve to be treated with respect.

·

I won’t respect someone who won’t respect me.

·

You are not better than me. Every human life is valuable in their own way.

·

We can die at any moment. No day is guaranteed. Why do you act like you are better than me?

·

What makes you better than me?

·

What makes you better than anyone?

·

Why am I the victim of your anger and high standards?

·

You saying that no one loves me shows your deep-rooted insecurities.

·

You are very aware that people do love me.

·

It is very sad that you would say something like that.

Follow this very simple, three-step process to become the narcissist’s worst nightmare.

Hit him where it hurts: his ego/image. Learn his darkest secrets, which will always directly contradict his public image/false mask. Then rub them in his face. For example, if he prides himself on being a “big dog” financially, point out that he got all his money in a very shady manner. If he tries hard to look like “the world’s nicest guy,” explain how you’re very, VERY aware he treats people (like you) worse than trash when it suits him.

Demonstrate his lack of control. He will become irate by the above unmasking and call you “deranged,” attempting to get you under control using your desire to be perceived as a good and nice person. Thank him for liberating you from the prison of caring what other people think, particularly HIM and his group of bullies/monkeys. Explain how his abuse backfired: by using bold-face lies to manipulate people into treating you like you were crazy, he set it up so you have nothing more to lose, which gives you permission—the first of your life—to actually BE crazy!


Live a happy, successful life. Narcissists hate this more than anything else. Just go out and succeed, refusing to accept the narcissist’s projected shame. This is the most effective way to force him out of his denial and make him face the problems he tried to shove off on you. So go out and shine—shine even brighter than you did when you attracted the narcissist’s attention.
Following these steps will absolutely slay the narcissist. He will slink away to hide under the nearest rock.

What are covert narcissists afraid of?

Stacey Rudin, Survived triangulation and a narcissistic smear campaign
Answered Feb 10
Covert narcissists are very cowardly, paranoid, and afraid of pretty much everything, but all of their anxieties may be distilled down to two main fears:

Exposure. A narcissist’s whole life is one big show, and she will do anything to keep it going, deceiving even herself into believing that things “aren’t as bad” as they really are. The level of denial and deception a narcissist will engage in to avoid dealing with the actual facts of her imperfect life will blow your mind.

Losing control. Related to the above, the narcissist feels so inherently vulnerable to exposure that she must have control at all times. She will death-grip onto every tiny bit of control she is able to seize upon, surrounding herself with people who only ever agree with her (such people are “controllable”), who permit her to self-destruct without ever questioning her.
The fact that narcissists live one big lie makes them inherently vulnerable, so these fears are not unfounded. They do need to maintain control, surround themselves with “yes-men,” and keep up their “big show of flawless bliss” at all costs. The alternative to this is total life destruction for the narcissist, since everyone around her would be appalled and horrified by the real person behind the curtain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------



How do you defeat a narcissist?

Stacey Rudin, Survivor Empowerment at Narcissistic Abuse Recovery (2019-present)

You defeat a narcissist by making him fear you. With patience and creativity, this is as easy as taking candy from a baby. Here are the steps.

Let the narcissist exhaust all of his ammunition against you.

This gives you all of the proof that you will ever need that he aims for maximum maliciousness, and only stops attacking when he’s out of ammo. When he comes begging you for mercy later, you can refer back to his own merciless behavior. **Waiting out this process can be taxing, but it is also very good quality entertainment. Remind yourself that the narc is busy digging his own grave.

Find a way to hit his ego real hard.

Narcissists are always hiding stuff, and if you’ve been with one for awhile, you definitely have ammo that can damage him. Tell his secrets to the people he least wants to know them. Be creative! Paint him into a corner!
Go completely nuts on him. Like, batsh*t, balls-to-the-wall crazy nuts. This emphasizes his lack of control, which narcs HATE.
The narcissist has already convinced everyone to believe you’re crazy, and to treat you as if you were crazy, so now you have nothing to lose: you get to actually BE CRAZY! **Oops! Silly narcissist should have been careful what he wished for!

Laugh at his attempts to intimidate and threaten you.

You have the upper hand thanks to (1), above. You can, and will, prove that he is legit insane. Never let him forget it!
With this combination of punches, the narcissist will know “he has been played!” He will enroll himself in the Narcissist Witness Protection Program, never to be seen again!

Which ten things make a narcissist miserable?

Stacey Rudin
Stacey Rudin, Survivor Empowerment at Narcissistic Abuse Recovery (2019-present)

Answered Nov 15 · Upvoted by Maggie Kanasto, M.S. Psychology & Sociology (2004)

Losing control (of anyone or anything).

Coming in second (everything is a contest).

“Looking bad” (in any way).

Feeling “left out of the group” (of superficial a**holes at “the top”).
The unraveling of a con job (these are supposed to fool ALL of the stupid humans).

Refusing to respect their false grandiose persona.

Exposing the truth about them (their “good guy” mask hides quite a creature).

Surprising them with a spontaneous gift or action. They will look on it with a jaundiced eye, perceiving it as a trap or con job, and will attack in response.

Implementing your own brilliant, unique plan to force them to suffer the consequences of abusing you.

Living a happy life after they plotted and actively pursued your demise.

Why does a narcissist need praise?

Phillip Johnson, Advocate for Survivors of NPD abuse
Answered Mar 26

Narcisissts need praise because they deplore themselves. They do not like who they are. They do not like the things that they do. If they are not being praised they are left with the dark empty vessel that is their heart. There is a perception that narcissists are actually happy with who they are. The appearance of an oversized ego and the facade of external happiness is a sham.

Narcissists need praise from people who do not see who they are. They need praise because they cannot sit in their hollow existence where they are always two steps away from posting a vacancy sign. Always open, come on in.

Praise means they can get through another day without self hatred. Praise means they don't have to feel worthless and inadequate. Praise means that while they will never meet their own expectations or the expectations that others have for them they can go to sleep with a win.

They need praise to get through the day. Praise means that even though they will never believe in themselves as much as you believe in them, they can fake it for another hour until they manipulate someone else into buying into their bullshit. That is all they are made of.

Praise means that they can temporarily forget that they have decimated every single thing in their life that was good. Praise means that they can feel what it is like to be human vicariously through your admiration. Praise means that they can forgive themselves for shutting off every empathathic feeling in their body.

Praise means that all they have to do is sleep with someone to hear thank you, you are amazing. Praise is oxygen. Praise is sustenance. Praise is the only thing that separates a narcissist from complete self destruction. Praise is heroin to a narcissist. Praise is the only God they will believe in.

How empty of me to be so full of you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


What scares a narcissist and makes them back off?
1 — Abandonment

If there is one thing that strikes fear in a narcissist it is abandonment. Think for a second and ask yourself these questions:

“Why do they always look for so many supplies?”

“Why do they enjoy discarding people?”

“And why do they go batshit insane when you don’t respond to a discarding?” (This is why I PREACH THE GOOD GOSPEL OF NO CONTACT. It is the best revenge)

The reason is that this is a major fear on their part. And because most narcissists really aren’t as smart or evolved as they think themselves to be, they cannot wrap their heads around being at peace with themselves.

And this is because these people are sadly: “an existence of pure chaos”.

Peace, order, serenity are alien concepts to them.

2 — Criticism

These people will criticize you in a heartbeat on how you look, walk, talk, eat, sleep and take a dump. But “Heavens To Murgatroyd” if you “suggest” a slight change in their outfit for the office party.

“You saying I’m fat?” (When the outfit is clearly revealing the truth)

“Why you like this tie? Is it because John wore it. Huh? HUHHHHHHHH? (Foam coming out the mouth)

This fear that narcissistic people have in regards to criticism comes from them having an extremely weak and fragile ego. This is exactly why they constantly need to find error and fault in everyone around them.

This is also why they feel a need to constantly compare others to someone else. In their minds, they cannot accept the fact that they may not be as good as they think/ or want.

So to defend their fragile egos they love to see other people fail and they love to sabotage others. They believe in their minds if they can get someone to fail it will damage their confidence.

Narcissistic people HATE CONFIDENT PEOPLE.

3 — Betrayal

It is okay if they betray us because in their minds “everyone betrays everyone”.

We better make sure that we never betray them. Even after the dozens of times, they have done so to us…ON A DAILY BASIS.

This fear that they have of betrayal again is a result of their fragile egos. Being betrayed to them feels like we are saying they are not enough. And as we have already said, these people fear not being good enough, hence the need to have so many friends, flashy cars, nice clothes and plenty of supply.

They are an addictive people.

4 — Humiliation

They hate the idea of being humiliated. This is why most of them are always scowling around. If they can look like they are someone NOT TO MESS WITH then nobody will mess with them.

They are in every sense of the word the missing link in our evolution. They are walking among us. This irrational fear of thinking everyone is out to make you look foolish or just wanting to hurt you is an UNEVOLVED way of thinking and living.

And yes, I know that there are many people out there like this. Hence is why I say “Narcissists aren’t as rare as we think they are.”

They are the missing link in our evolution. We can’t find it because they are standing right next to us. Being an empath is a step up in our evolution.

To them, humiliation means a sign of weakness. And like animals out in the wilderness, the moment they show weakness they will get eaten alive.

And humiliation is like being eaten alive by the eyes and opinions of PEOPLE THEY DON’T KNOW.


---------------------------------------------------



Why does a narcissist always have the need to watch you?
Watching everything you do allows them to know ‘everything’ about you while you know very little about THEM. They know who your friends are. They know how you talk to people. They know where you go. They know when you go there. They know when you’re most apt to be home, when you’re most apt to be working, when you’re most apt to be socializing, with who, and where. They know your mannerisms. They know how other people react toward you. They know how you react toward other people. They know what or who makes you frown. They know what or who makes you smile.

When they can’t watch everything you do, they know who can tell them ‘everything’ you did. They know whether or not you will TELL them everything you did because they have other people watching you when they can’t. What you tell them you did when they couldn’t watch you has to match EXACTLY with what the person watching you for them tells them. They’ll often throw shit in the game by accusing you of doing things that they KNOW you didn’t do just to make you think you weren’t being ‘watched’. Then they can blame any ‘misinformation’ on what “somebody told me”. Usually, AFTER they have tried to punish you somehow for that ‘misinformation’ that was somebody else’s fault, when in reality they just made up an accusation to try to make you defend yourself for something they KNOW you didn’t do.

They watch your routine so they know where and when they can ‘accidentally’ run into you if you won’t or don’t come around them to be ‘watched’. They know your routine so they know when to ask you to do something for or with them. They know your routine so they know when you won’t be around to see what THEY are doing.

They want to know ‘everything’ you do and know your routine so they can either interfere in what you do, use what you do against you, pretend to be like you with your friends, and make them damn near impossible to avoid whenever THEY want to contact you.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Who are the most important threats to narcissists, and why is that?
There are many threats perceived by a narcissistic personality, but I will highlight here their six major fears:

Insults and criticism

Narcissist’s self-esteem is very fragile. Everyone must constantly take care of and support their narcissistic ego. Any disapproval, even a constructive one, is perceived by a narcissist as an insult and can tear their inner world apart. They can’t stand any public humiliation, so they can’t accept any criticism or jokes about themselves in any form.

2. Rejection


The narcissist can’t accept any type of rejection. Any person who refuses them is immediately perceived as an enemy. Narcissist’s self-esteem drops very quickly from any refusal or rejection, causing them unbearable inner pain.

3. Own imperfection


Every narcissist knows about their own imperfections, however, to voice it or to admit to others is equal to self-destruction. Therefore, they hide it from themselves and from others in every possible way. If they fail, they blame their associates, friends, relatives, loved ones - everyone who is lowered by a narcissist from the pedestal of greatness.

4. Losing


The narcissist is so perfect that even the thought of losing causes them to experience a tremendous storm of negative internal emotions. Everything that this personality type does should be successful and grandiose. And even if they succeed in 1 out of 100 projects, you will hear from them about this successful one forever.

5. Obligations/Long-term relationships


Narcissists fear being in a warm, open, long-term relationships. They can’t genuinely express themselves and show their weaknesses. They can’t be open and vulnerable, as they feel it is unsafe for their “perfect” self. Therefore, many narcissistic individuals often avoid or intentionally jeopardize long-term relationships.

6. Being invisible


Constant admiration of narcissists is an essential part of their life. They need attention, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every year. Constantly. It is very common for the narcissist to be angry that they do not receive admiration and attention, especially from those who have done it before. Therefore, the camp of “enemies” is constantly increasing from those who have ceased to admire them.

What are your 10 best phrases for disarming or shutting down a narcissist?

Instead of memorizing 10 disarming phrases, consider practicing this extremely powerful but simple 3-step algorithm handling not only narcissists, but anyone who is trying to manipulate, criticize, belittle, or argue with you. It is one of the most valuable hidden communication tools that will positively change your life erasing the victim’s mentality, make more friends from enemies, and influence the lives of others in a mutually beneficial way.

Step #0: Do not show any anger towards that person. Maintain control of your emotions, don’t raise your voice. And look always directly into a person’s eyes - friendly & confidently. It is critically important!


Step #1: Acknowledgement in one word or short phrase that you hear them: “Ok”, “Understood”, “I see”…

Step# 2: Your short answer in a calm way (preferably with a smile 😃and a bit of humor). Example: “It is good that you tell me this” or “I see that you have certain wishes”, “You are entitled to your opinion”, “It is interesting, that you have made this conclusion”

Step #3: Your open-ended counter-question(s) to transfer attention from you to your opponent ( Like a school teacher, in a sense). Example: “Why do you think it is important to you?”, “Why are you telling me this?”, “Tell me, what do you really want to say?”, “What do you think makes you think this way?”, “How do you think we can change the situation?”


Conclusion:

A narcissistic, toxic, manipulative person is attacking others from a place of their deepest inner pain and unhappiness. Subconsciously they want you to hate them - to suck you into their misery. Do not let them! Be above that low-frequency level - try keeping conversation with them in an easygoing/ friendly manner, like you are looking at an “ok” human being in front of you.
Subconsciously, whoever states open-ended questions - is in control and commanding authority. So, always instead of arguing or explaining or defending yourself - keep asking your opponent open-ended questions. Put them in the position of explaining, defending, and answering to you. It is of utmost importance!
This algorithm is, in a sense, “teaching” the manipulator or any toxic person as a child at their subconscious level about healthy human communication and to reflect upon themselves.
If you follow these instructions to the tee - it will work like magic 100% of the time! I recommend practicing it daily, so it will be engraved into your subconscious mind. And have fun with it!
P.S. All the above is advisable provided you wish to continue communicating with the person. Sometimes it is wiser simply to hit the “delete”, “block” button, or go no contact.

How can I tell that someone is a dangerous person that can do harm?
Originally Answered: What are the telltale signs that someone could be potentially violent?
I have not met many violent people in my lifetime, thank goodness.

Those who turned out to be violent usually had the following characteristics:

actually enjoyed confrontations
never backed down
never said sorry
were always sure to be right
had clear and unalterable views on things
had a strong “us and them” perspective
overstepped boundaries easily
There is a dangerous concept out there in the mainstream, traded as desirable: that of the “alpha male”. It was always that kind of person who turned out to be violent and ended up in trouble in my life experience.

So, also be very careful when you meet self centred characters like that. They will don the hat of the protector, provider, and leader, and before you know it, they’ve gone way too far.

Why would a narcissist fear you?
A narcissist would fear you if you were able to cause them a great amount of shame.

Despite what the no contacters say, this is not the ultimate way to hurt a narcissist. If you go no contact, they have many avenues to salvage their precious image - for starters they have already smeared you as worthless and crazy. If you however are able to dumpster their image in a very public way, this causes the narcissist incredible anguish.

You see, narcissism is a defence against shame.

At some point in the development of the narcissist, the young child decides that no matter what, they would never feel shame again, not for a minute, not for a second. They would do whatever they could, no matter the cost to themselves or others, to outsource their shame.

An impossible mission.

They do this by using all the procedures you're very familiar with - gaslighting, silent treatments, word salads, rage, blame shifting and so on.

If you are able to break through the narcissist's defences - to psychically tar and feather them, mark them as a pariah to all who know them, you will force them to feel shame for which they would have no defence. You are essentially pinning them down and pouring it all over them, like acid onto third degree burns.

By doing this, you have overwhelmed all their defences, there is no way they can explain to so many people at once whatever it is you have done to their image. The way they look at the narcissist has changed - gone is the adoration, the respect, the worship, it is replaced by disgust, repulsion, derision.

Here is where they lose it, become utterly insane and act in the most shameless ways possible.

They become, as esteemed Dr Vaknin has pointed out many, many times, Secondary Psychopaths.

This is what lurks underneath the mask of sanity, somebody totally crazy, deranged, a shameful lunatic.

Horribly embarrassing to be exposed for what they are, and if you have the power to do this to them, to utterly invert their grandiosity, of course they will fear you. No contact would only fell the most weakened, supply hungry of narcissists.

Shame is their kryptonite,
