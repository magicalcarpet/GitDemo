Scoring goals has been a problem for Northern Ireland for some time. 
Well, taking chances has been the problem to be more precise.

They have been creating plenty of opportunities under Ian Baraclough, 
but too often the manager has been left to rue missed chances.

However, Greece have travelled to Belfast with a squad of 27 that boosts 
only 26 international goals between them.

Kyle Lafferty (20) and Steven Davis (13) have more than that between them, 
with the Northern Ireland squad's combined goals tally sitting at 61.

All that will mean nothing once the match kicks off, of course, but it's interesting nonetheless.
